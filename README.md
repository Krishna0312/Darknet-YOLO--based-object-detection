# Object_Detection
Darknet is an open source neural network framework. It is a fast and highly accurate framework for real time object detection (also can be used for images).
In the provided notebook, a fast and simple approach is shown to detect one or more objects within an image. 

## The procedure is described below:
- GPU was enabled 
- Cloned into the darknet repository
- Built darknet into the chosen folder
- Downloaded weights in order to use those weights on unseen images
- Made predictions on several images
## Note:
 - Darknet used here is pretrained on COCO dataset. Thus, making predictions is faster and simpler.
